Visual Studio 2019 is here! On April 2nd we broadcasted a full day of awesome Visual Studio 2019 technical content to celebrate the launch and get you up to speed with all the new features. This repo contains creative and technical content for running a local launch event or watch party in your community.

# Event Guidelines
You are free to organize a watch party to view the online broadcast live and/or organize a presentation, workshop, or hack-a-thon anytime until June 30.
